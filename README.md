## Deployment steps:
1. If you are running for the first time, run setup.sh script.
2. If you are making some changes, run run-dev.sh or run-debug.sh as required.
3. If you want to stop the containers, run stop-dev.sh or stop-debug.sh as required.
4. If you want to stop everything and clean up, run down.sh. **Note: This will cleanup all data from DBs**
